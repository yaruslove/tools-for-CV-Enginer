I guess every CV enginer rewrite simple tools every time when there are a need. During the year it takes a lot of time. There fore I desided collect them on at arm's length.

1. **graber_frame** - script which take frames from videos with preset frequency value
2. **cut_yolo_bbox** - script which cut objects from images and save them to separate folder.
Labels for cutting get from YOLO labels .txt files
