## Repo collect usefull tools for Computer vision Enginer
![](tools.png)

I guess every CV enginer rewrite simple tools every time when there are a need. During the year it takes a lot of time. There fore I desided collect them on at arm's length.

1. [**001_yolo_tools**](001_yolo_tools) - scripts and utils for work with yolo
2. [**002_process_images**](002_process_images) - scripts and utils for working with images: compress, rotate, change format
3. [**003_process_videos**](003_process_videos) - process videos: grab frames from video and another tools
4. [**004_augumentation**](004_augumentation) via Pytorch tools. There are set of augumentation methods
5. [**005_process_collect_dataset**](005_process_collect_dataset) - scripts and utils for processing dataset
6. [**006_images_algorithm**](006_images_algorithm)
7. [**007_segment**](007_segment) - tools for working with segment task panoptic, instance.
