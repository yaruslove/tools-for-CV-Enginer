2. **cut_yolo_bbox** - script which cut objects from images and save them to separate folder.
Labels for cutting get from YOLO labels .txt files
3. **change_yolo_classes** - change YOLO labels agree with dictionary 1→2 ,2→3
4. **augumentation** via Pytorch tools. There are set of augumentation methods
5. **converter** COCO2YOLO
